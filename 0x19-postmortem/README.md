#0x19. Postmortem

A complete service outage occurrd on June 5, 2023, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM (PST), rendering the web application unavailable to all users. The episode was at first identified when clients announced the site being lethargic. Engineers explored the issue, thinking a new server setup change, yet found it was irrelevant. Consideration went to the data set layer because of blunders in the server logs. It was discovered that a temporary loss of connectivity between the web server and the database server was the root cause after following several false leds and involving the senior development team. Restarting the database server and reestablishing the connection solved the problem. The team will set up regular maintenance for updates and patches, consider redundancy and failover mechanisms,and implement monitoring for database connectivity to prevent similar outages in the future.
